Large-scale assessment",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,"Adaptation of tools to the official language of instruction and to national educational and cultural context is a common principle of cross-comparative studies as SEA-PLM regional assessment. The main source versions of the instruments are developed in consensus with countries and in alignment with Southeast Asian educational context in primary education and community environment. SEA-PLM countries agree on a necessary set of standardized items to be used across all participating countries. Procedures are made to ensure that each adapted contextual question (like the one to measure SEL/SS) is both relevant to the target population and equivalent to the source version. Specific terms within instruments are adapted in such a way as to ensure their comparability across countries. Clear protocol and methodology are designed, applied, recorded, and monitored by participating countries and technical providers to contextualize the tools. ","All Ministries of Education in participating countries are directly involved in the design and development of the tools and their national adaptation through the central directions in charge of system-level monitoring learning and assessment. Through national teams appointed for the entire duration of the project, technical and institutionalized local capacities are strengthened in large-scale assessment and measurement methods as well as mechanisms and systems to monitor learning. During data collection, data collectors and school leaders are informed on instrument contents and trained by their Ministry to conduct field activities against SEA-PLM procedures and standardized data collection procedures to ensure strict test and questionnaire administration conditions and processes. ","The test and questionnaire content are developed in concert and collaboration with each participating country to assure some level of cultural equivalence between national cultures, the main sub-groups of populations, and relevancy for young (ages 10–12) children enrolled in Grade 5. The basis of the conceptual framework and the main topic of interest/measurement are defined by countries and technical experts, and some components are refined from one measurement cycle to the next (currently SEA-PLM 2024 in reference to the period of the next main survey data collection). A set of trends items/subset of questions, constructs, and indicators remains unchanged to guarantee comparison and measurement of educational and behavioral changes across time.","The SEA-PLM framework, concepts, and measurement scope and limitations are largely discussed with participating countries before starting a new round of assessment, and every year based on the latest survey development and various sets of calibration and validation of the instruments.

System monitoring",1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,LSC tools have been developed in partnership with four State education departments. They have been developed in the language of the State. Workshops were conducted with local and government experts to do a word-by-word review of each item and validate the tools from a measurement and contextualization point of view. Pilots were conducted based on a representative sample from 18 districts across the four states to ensure that the tools were scientific and yet contextual. ,Government stakeholders and trainers were trained to administer the LSC assessment tools with the students in the state.,"Ensuring that local mores are captured and adapted item-by-item to account for tribal, rural, urban, and peri-urban contexts (not just language, but references to popular culture, foods, etc.). The tools have been created in four languages and contextualized for local and regional differences. The tools have also been divided by age group and are available in Junior (11 to 14 years) and Senior (15 to 18 years) formats. ","Tools are designed to inform at the systemic level. The set of four tools measure student proficiency for future readiness and social and emotional well-being skills (2 tools); teacher ability to transact the skills in the classroom (1 tool), and the system's readiness to implement a life skills program at the state level (1 tool).

All the tools can be (and have been) used in any large scale program as a baseline tool or a progam evaluation tool. ",[NO RESPONSE],"Validation was a multistep process, from ensuring the tool is viable at the student level to a larger population. Our steps included:
Understanding the internal reliability of the tools via testing and retesting; Conducting extensive KIIs for qualitative measures; Using focus group discussions for the development of the teacher tool to validate some existing understanding and hypotheses of the journey of a teacher with life skills; 
Establishment of Assessment Working Groups: Composed of members with different backgrounds and varied areas of expertise from across the 18 LSC partner organizations. This also involved getting inputs from external and international experts on tool design.
Establishment of Government Working Groups: 15–20 government experts in each state, with representation from the state as well as the district level ensuring a multitude of perspectives came together.
Focus on Co-creation and transparency in rigor of tool design and development: Expectation setting, establishment of tool development process, multiple workshops, validation and pilot rigor to establish tool credibility.

Following a literature review, select consultation with creativity experts, cognitive pretesting, and some initial testing, this proposed creativity tool has been piloted in Ethiopia to analyze the psychometric reliability and validity of the tool. Piloting may be expanded to Tanzania and Uganda, but discussions are still in progress.  
  
The creativity tool includes two play-based activities—including verbal and drawing/coloring—that measure creativity through fluency, originality, technical, aesthetic, and overall creativity. The tool uses the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT), the golden standard in creativity research, to overcome the challenge of defining and contextualizing creativity. The CAT technique involves a team of experts looking at products created by the children and rating them in relation to one another on a scale of 1 to 5 on overall creativity, originality, aesthetic appeal, curiosity, and technical quality. This tool is the first of its kind to be used in a conflict, crisis, and emergency setting.

We have instead chosen to harness the strengths of CAT and develop a more standardized measurement of creativity contextualized for the area and type of activity using CAT in the development of a rubric. The CAT approach acknowledges that creativity can be appropriately evaluated by comparing products within a specific domain, relying on the discernment of experts to develop a standardized rubric relevant to the context, rather than adhering to a rigid definition of creativity that does not pertain to the sociocultural context. Such flexibility is crucial, considering the contentious nature of defining creativity and its applicability across diverse contexts.

It is quite difficult to have a tool that responds to all needs. The validated tool right now responds to the needs of policymakers by providing evidence on the level of life skills adolescents (13–17 years old) possess. We are starting the process of developing a contextualized tool that addresses the needs of educators in the primary school classrooms.,"The process was guided by a renowned professor with huge experience in SEL measurement, but it took almost two years to develop the tools and analyze the data. All work was conducted in partnership with local experts to enhance their knowledge and skills on how to identify the construct of each selected competency, how to create tasks, how to validate the tool, and how to analyze the data collected.",The process took into consideration all these aspects. It was extremely participatory to ensure grassroots validation and appropriateness. The tool was translated into over 20 languages.,"The ALiVE tool was designed to get a glimpse of functioning across life skills and values, as aspired to by ministries of education in the respective educational jurisdictions. The assessments were not designed for diagnosis of individual functioning, but rather to establish a basis upon which countries might evaluate their educational goals, given their embrace of life skills and values in recent years, and to inform their curricular planning. ","In 2020–2023, the Assessment of Life Skill and Values (ALiVE) project was undertaken in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. The project was designed to support countries in developing test items for problem-solving, collaboration, respect, and self-awareness for large-scale assessments. The aim was to generate evidence by using a contextually appropriate tool to inform policymakers’ decisions.","The ALiVE tool was developed through a participatory process that started with a contextualization study designed to explore the nature of the selected life skills and values in the East African community. From the contextualization study, the conceptual structures of the target constructs were agreed upon, followed by development of assessment frameworks that identified the measurable components of those constructs. Guided by the assessment frameworks, the ALiVE team embarked on task and item development in April 2021, and finalized the large-scale assessments by August 2022, reaching 45,442 adolescents.",The ALiVE tool was not developed to assess impact.,"The ALiVE team committed considerable effort to defining and describing the target constructs. This was undertaken due to both observance of a well-established test and scale development model, and the combination of two relatively recent innovations: first, the assessment of 21st century skills remains in its early days; and second, household-based assessment at large scale has emerged in the past decade as an acceptable and sufficiently stringent approach to the collection of data that prompt government action. Ensuring a common understanding of the target competencies is not only essential in the routine test and scale development processes, but in ensuring the same understandings when hundreds of Test Administrators and other personnel are involved in data collection.",The ALiVE tool aimed at assessing competences in the East African environment and efforts were made to ensure its appropriateness. We did not assess specific environmental aspects.,"The role of the environment in Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of individual and collective development. For this reason we developed task items that were deeply related to the environment in which East African adolescents were living. We clearly identified and defined the specific factors, like the community dynamics, family support, and broader societal influences, that could have influenced the answers of the adolescents. We integrated tasks and questions that were specifically relatable to the daily life of the target group. To ensure this, we engaged teachers, students, parents, and community members in the assessment process. Their perspectives can offer valuable insights into how the environment influences SEL and SS outcomes.",We developed the tool in partnership with the government and the government representatives were present as part of the academy who developed the tool. Then we decided to go for a community-based assessment to engage families and community leaders and foster a process of grassroots advocacy.,"The ALiVE tool was designed to get a glimpse of functioning across life skills and values, as aspired to by ministries of education in East Africa. The assessments were not designed for diagnosis of individual functioning, but rather to establish a basis upon which countries might evaluate their educational goals, given their embrace of life skills and values in recent years, and to inform their curriculum planning. ",The initiative is an initiative of the Regional Education Learning Initiative (RELI) which gathers together over 70 organizations in East Africa.,We somehow created our own language . . . by contextualizing the constructs (through a rapid ethnographic study).,[NO RESPONSE],Still a lot needs to be done.

The focus of the remedial program is to build foundational literacy and numeracy skills in grade 3–5 learners who are lagging through accelerated learning methods that are more learner centered and fun. The program is currently being implemented in about 4,900 schools in eight of the ten provinces. In this study, we sought to examine the contribution of the Catch Up program on social and emotional learning (SEL) for children in Lusaka province. The theory of change was anchored in literature that links learning through play to holistic development or development of SEL competencies in children.

Thus, we try to advocate that “life skills contribute to academic skills, well-being and others” in line with other available global evidence. Also, some donors still fund reproductive health–related life skills for adolescent girls instead of holistic skills including SEL/SS for all. For example, although many donors at the national conference mentioned previously highlighted the importance of life skills in general/theoretically, there was no concrete example on SEL/SS, which shows a part of reality. This pilot initiative also aims to explore entry points for integrating SEL/SS into the ongoing JICA project and future interventions.","Collective action on (1) awareness raising (national/international level); (2) discussion platform for holistic skills; (3) practice on multiple formative assessments, training, evidence generation (both small scale and longitudinal studies); (4) creating a culture of learning by doing, and learning by assessing (as opposed to the traditional notion of assessment as punishment for low performance/capacity); (5) minimum funding.
